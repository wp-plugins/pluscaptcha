== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is CAPTCHA? =

A CAPTCHA is a type of challenge-response test used in computing as an attempt to ensure that the response is generated by a person. The term CAPTCHA is an acronym based on the word "capture" and standing for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart. Invented by Luis von Ahn, defeated by the bots today.

= It's Free =

Technically no. It's free by 10 years. But we estimate the life time of an website and it's less than 3 years. Later, the price will be defined the same user with the "price" of the quality service we provide. The value will be specific by the webmaster, not by us.

Why 10 years? Because we are looking for a company of 100 years, and we think this is our first step.
